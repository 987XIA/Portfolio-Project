# Project Background
**Company Information:** This project was conducted using data from a hypothetical company operating in the digital marketing sector, which has been active for several years. The company leverages social media platforms to enhance brand visibility and customer engagement through targeted advertising.

**Key Business Metrics:** The primary metrics analyzed included Reach, Impressions, Click-Through Rate (CTR), Cost Per Click (CPC), and Conversions. These metrics help the company measure the effectiveness of their social media campaigns and optimize their advertising spend.

### Insights and Recommendations

**Category 1: Audience Targeting**

- Insights on the effectiveness of Lookalike Audiences (LLA) versus Detailed Targeting (DT) with recommendations on when to use each strategy.

**Category 2: Ad Set Performance**

- Detailed analysis of ad set performance across 'Hot', 'Warm', and 'Cold' audience segments to identify which ads drive the most engagement and conversions.

**Category 3: Cost Efficiency**

- Evaluation of Cost Per Result (CPR) across different ad sets and recommendations for budget reallocation to optimize ad spend.

**Category 4: Engagement and Conversion**

- Insights into the drop-off from link clicks to landing page views and strategies to improve landing page effectiveness.

# Data Structure & Initial Checks

**Database Structure:** The company's main database consists of tables corresponding to ad campaigns, user interactions, and conversion metrics. Each table is structured as follows:

- **Table 1: Campaign Details**
- **Table 2: User Interactions**
- **Table 3: Conversion Metrics**
- **Table 4: Budget and Spending**



# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

This project highlights the crucial role of targeted ad strategies in optimizing marketing campaigns. Key findings indicate that Detailed Targeting tends to yield higher conversion rates compared to Lookalike Audiences, which are better suited for increasing brand awareness.



# Insights Deep Dive
**Category 1: Audience Targeting**

- **Main Insight 1:** LLA achieves higher reach but lower conversion rates compared to DT.
- **Main Insight 2:** DT audiences, though smaller, are more likely to convert due to more precise targeting.

**Category 2: Ad Set Performance**

- **Main Insight 1:** 'Hot' ad sets typically perform better in terms of engagement and initial conversions.
- **Main Insight 2:** 'Cold' ad sets require more strategic planning to convert new users.

**Category 3: Cost Efficiency**

- **Main Insight 1:** CPR varies significantly across ad sets, with 'Hot Discount' ad sets proving most cost-efficient.
- **Main Insight 2:** High CPR in 'Cold' ad sets suggests a need for improved targeting or creative content.

**Category 4: Engagement and Conversion**

- **Main Insight 1:** Significant drop-offs in the 'Warm' category indicate potential issues with ad relevance or landing page design.
- **Main Insight 2:** Enhancing content on landing pages could substantially increase conversions from high-interest clicks.



# Recommendations:

Based on the insights and findings above, recommendations for the marketing team include:

- Prioritize Detailed Targeting for conversion-focused campaigns.
- Reallocate budget from underperforming 'Cold' ad sets to 'Hot' or 'Warm' ad sets with higher conversion potential.
- Investigate and resolve issues causing drop-offs from link clicks to landing page views.


# Assumptions and Caveats:

**Assumptions:**

- Historical ad performance trends were used to impute missing values for incomplete ad sets.

**Caveats:**

- The analysis assumes that all ad interactions are independent of external marketing activities.
